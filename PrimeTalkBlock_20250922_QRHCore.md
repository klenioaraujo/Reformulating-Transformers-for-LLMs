SKELETON: QRH operator applies spectral filtering and quaternionic stabilization to suppress semantic noise.
REHYDRATE:
  The QRHLayer class implements the mathematical operator ΨQRH = R_left · F^{-1} { F(k) · F { Ψ } } · R_right, where input tensors are projected into 4D quaternionic space before spectral filtering. The qrh_layer.py module contains robust input validation, FFT caching for computational efficiency, and support for both learnable and fixed rotations through theta_left, omega_left, phi_left parameters and their right-side equivalents.

  Processing follows three main stages: preprocessing via v_proj for [B,T,4*D] → [B,T,D,4] conversion, spectral filtering application using SpectralFilter in frequency domain, and post-processing with quaternionic rotations followed by output projection. The implementation includes special handling for NaN/Inf values, Automatic Mixed Precision support on compatible devices, and residual connections for training stability.

  Quaternionic rotations are calculated via QuaternionOperations.create_unit_quaternion_batch for efficiency, while spectral filtering utilizes torch.fft for fast transforms. The check_health method provides energy conservation metrics for monitoring model stability during inference operations.
