# Calibrated FCI Thresholds
# =========================
# Thresholds calibrated based on ΨTWS training data analysis
# Generated by test_fci_thresholds.py

# Analysis Date: 2025-10-01
# Data Source: 4 ΨTWS files (training + validation + test)
# FCI Distribution: mean=0.628, std=0.033, range=[0.574, 0.665]

  # EMERGENCE: High consciousness states (top 25%)

    fractal_dimension_min: 2.288  # (2.288 - 1.0) / 2.0 = 0.644

  # MEDITATION: Meditative states (median)

# Implementation Notes
# ========================================

implementation:
  - "These thresholds are calibrated for the current ΨTWS dataset"
  - "Re-calibrate when adding new training data"
  - "Monitor FCI distribution for drift over time"
  - "Use these thresholds in consciousness_metrics.py"

# Usage Example
# ========================================

usage_example: |
  from src.conscience.consciousness_metrics import ConsciousnessMetrics
  import yaml

  # Load calibrated thresholds
  with open('calibrated_fci_thresholds.yaml', 'r') as f:
      calibrated_config = yaml.safe_load(f)

  # Create metrics with calibrated thresholds
  config = {'device': 'cpu'}
  metrics = ConsciousnessMetrics(config, calibrated_config)

  # Now FCI classification uses calibrated thresholds
