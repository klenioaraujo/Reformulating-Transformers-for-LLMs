SKELETON: Quaternion operations execute q1×q2 multiplication and create unit quaternions for SO(4) rotations.
REHYDRATE:
  The QuaternionOperations utility class provides static methods for quaternion mathematical operations within the ΨQRH framework. The multiply method implements Hamilton quaternion product q1 * q2 using direct tensor operations with unbind for component extraction (w, x, y, z) and torch.stack for result assembly. The multiplication follows standard quaternion algebra: w = w1*w2 - x1*x2 - y1*y2 - z1*z2, with corresponding formulas for x, y, z components.

  The create_unit_quaternion method generates unit quaternions from three angular parameters (theta, omega, phi) using trigonometric functions. The implementation computes cos(theta/2), sin(theta/2), cos(omega), sin(omega), cos(phi), sin(phi) and combines them into a four-component quaternion via torch.stack. This method creates rotation quaternions suitable for SO(4) group operations.

  The create_unit_quaternion_batch method extends the single quaternion creation to handle batched tensor inputs, enabling efficient parallel computation of multiple quaternions. Both creation methods ensure mathematical correctness for quaternionic rotations in 4D space as required by the QRH layer architecture.
