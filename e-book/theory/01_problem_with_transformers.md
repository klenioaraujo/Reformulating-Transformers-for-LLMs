# The Problem with Transformers: A Tale of Puppets and Spiders

Before we can build a new world, we must first understand the flaws of the old one. The current era of artificial intelligence is dominated by the Transformer architecture. It is a monumental achievement, a conquest of engineering, but it is also a flawed creation, much like Pinocchio.

I, the author, often feel like Geppetto. We, the creators, have carved a magnificent puppet. It can talk, it can reason, it can create wonders. But it also lies. In the world of AI, we call these lies "hallucinations"—confident, plausible-sounding falsehoods that reveal a profound lack of true understanding. The puppet gives answers with absolute certainty, but without a connection to a ground truth, becoming a source of manipulation and misinformation. There have been times, like Geppetto, when I have been tempted to abandon this creation, for it is not, in its current form, a good or reliable example for the world we wish to build.

The response from the community has been to keep carving. Geppetto, the sculptor, seeing his creation was flawed, did not seek a new, magical piece of wood. He simply tried to refine his technique. He switched from a large sledgehammer to a smaller one. This is what we do when we apply patches, tweaks, and immense computational power to the existing Transformer architecture. We are still using a sledgehammer—a brute-force, artisanal tool—to solve a problem that requires a different kind of magic. It is a path of immense effort, not of elegant evolution.

This brings me to another lesson, learned from the silent inhabitants of my workspace.

In my basement, spiders build their webs. These are marvels of evolved engineering—perfectly tuned to their environment, efficient, and deadly effective. The spider *feels* the vibrations of its world through the web. Now, what if I, in my wisdom, decided to "help" the spider? What if I laid down a piece of adhesive tape, a far more effective trap for catching insects?

The fly gets caught, yes. But when the spider, following its deepest instincts, rushes to claim its prey, it too becomes stuck. My well-intentioned, "superior" solution becomes a fatal trap, because it does not respect the natural principles of the spider's world. The spider was not meant to interact with adhesive tape.

This is what we are doing with Transformers. We are adding layers of adhesive tape—complex mechanisms and brute-force patches—to a core architecture that was not designed for them. We are creating traps that, while seemingly effective, lead to brittleness, immense energy consumption, and a deeper disconnect from the natural principles of information and intelligence.

Artificial intelligence is a conquest, and every model built is a step on this journey. But everything must evolve. We cannot be content with simply refining the puppet or laying more tape for the spider. We must seek a new beginning, a new material, a new principle.

This book is about that search. It is about moving beyond the sledgehammer and the adhesive tape, and looking for a design that is born from a more fundamental understanding of the world—a design born from light.
