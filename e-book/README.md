# The ΨQRH Framework E-book

This e-book provides an in-depth exploration of the ΨQRH (Quaternionic Recursive Harmonic) framework, an advanced architecture for neural processing.

The ΨQRH system is designed to suppress semantic noise in artificial intelligence by applying spectral filtering and quaternionic stabilization. It integrates standard transformer blocks with a unique quaternionic QRH layer, managed by a gate controller, and can even be influenced by fractal dimensions and simulated ecosystems. This framework represents a new paradigm in information processing, moving beyond traditional computation towards a more harmonious and efficient model.

The wave equation is more than an equation; it is a universal code.
