SKELETON: Spectral filter implements complex response F(k) = amplitude × exp(i×phase) in frequency domain.
REHYDRATE:
  The SpectralFilter class implements a logarithmic phase filter F(k) for negentropy filtering with enhanced numerical stability. The module spectral_filter.py contains initialization parameters alpha (default 1.0), epsilon (1e-10 for numerical stability), use_stable_activation boolean flag, and windowing options including hann, hamming, and blackman window types.

  The forward method applies spectral filtering through k_mag clamping to avoid extreme values, followed by either GELU-based stable activation or arctan-based phase calculation. The corrected implementation includes proper amplitude scaling using torch.pow(k_mag_clamped + epsilon, -alpha/2.0) to achieve |H(f)|² ∝ f^(-α) power law slope, combined with phase modulation exp(1j * phase) for complete complex response.

  The apply_window method reduces spectral leakage by applying windowing functions to input signals before FFT operations. Invalid values (NaN/Inf) are replaced with identity response (ones_like) to maintain numerical stability throughout the filtering process.
