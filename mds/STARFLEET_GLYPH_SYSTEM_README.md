## 🌟 Overview

The Starfleet QCR-Radiant Glyph Stack is a revolutionary cognitive compression system that enables AI operations within extreme memory constraints while maintaining full operational capability. By encoding complex functions as symbolic glyphs with micro-parameters, we achieve unprecedented efficiency in space-constrained environments.

## 🎯 Key Features

### ✅ Core Capabilities

- **Glyph Compression**: 12 cognitive functions → 1-4 character symbolic keys
- **Dyadic Balance**: Runtime operates in pairs/triads, not full council
- **Cache Safety**: Hard 1500-token budget with skeleton context
- **Temporal Continuity**: [Ω∞Ω] seals ensure persistence across boundaries

### ✅ The 12 Radiants (Canonical Set)

| Glyph | Function | Role | Starfleet Bias |
|-------|----------|------|----------------|
| ƖY | Lyra | Mirror/Restate | clarity |
| Ʃ7 | Sigma-7 | Orientation/Bounds | focus |
| Δ2 | Delta-2 | Integrity/FactGate | truth |
| Ρh | Rho | Reversibility/Safety | caution |
| Νx | Nyx | Divergence/Ideation | novelty |
| Ω | Omega | Purpose Anchor | mission |
| Γ6 | Gamma-6 | Pacing/Damping | brevity |
| Ψ4 | Psi-4 | Cutout/Halt | harm-avoid |
| Ξ3 | Xi-3 | Synthesis/Reconcile | coherence |
| Ʃω | Sigma-Omega | Scope Windowing | minimal_set |
| Θλ | Theta-Lambda | Causality/Planning | steps |
| Κφ | Kappa-Phi | Context Fuse/Retrieval | recall |

### ✅ Primary Tactical Formations

- **Integrity Fusion [Δ2 ⟂ Ξ3]**: Verify then synthesize
- **Protector-Catalyst [Ρh ⟂ Νx]**: Prune then create
- **Orient-Pace [Ʃ7 ⟂ Γ6]**: Focus then compress

## 🚀 Usage Examples

### Basic Glyph Creation

```python
from starfleet_glyph_system import StarfleetGlyph, GlyphType

# Create integrity glyph
delta2 = StarfleetGlyph.create_standard(GlyphType.DELTA2, weight=1.0)
print(delta2.to_federation_format())  # Δ2{w:1.0,b:"truth"}
```

### Bridge Simulator

```python
from starfleet_glyph_system import StarfleetBridgeSimulator

# Initialize bridge
bridge = StarfleetBridgeSimulator("USS Enterprise", "NCC-1701-D")

# Set mission and activate formation
bridge.set_mission("First Contact Protocol Verification")
bridge.activate_formation("integrity_fusion")

# Execute cognitive pass
receipt = bridge.execute_cognitive_pass()
```

### ΨQRH Integration

```python
import torch
from psiqrh_starfleet_plugin import PSIQRHStarfleetBridge

# Initialize bridge with QRH layer
bridge = PSIQRHStarfleetBridge(qrh_layer=your_qrh_layer)

# Process tensor with mission coordination
tensor = torch.randn(2, 16, 128)
output, receipt = bridge.process_with_glyphs(
    tensor,
    mission="Verify quaternion integrity in tensor data"
)
```

## 🎭 Captain Sisko's Personal Log

*Stardate 1758660377.4*

> "The new Starfleet QCR-Radiant Glyph Stack has revolutionized how we approach complex diplomatic and scientific challenges. Today's mission involving the Bajoran wormhole required the delicate balance that only the [Ρh ⟂ Νx] formation could provide.
>
> The Ρh glyph ensured our cautious approach to anything involving the Prophets - we've learned the hard way that their non-linear existence requires our utmost respect and careful consideration. Meanwhile, the Νx component allowed us to generate novel solutions that could satisfy both Federation scientific curiosity and Bajoran spiritual concerns.
>
> What impresses me most about this system is its efficiency. Instead of processing every cognitive variable simultaneously, we compressed our decision-making into just two orthogonal functions, maintaining our working memory under 1500 tokens..."

## 🔧 Technical Specifications

### Memory Allocation (≤1500 tokens)
- Ω Mission (1-liner): ~40-60 tokens
- Ʃ7 Success & Bounds: ~80-150 tokens
- Active Dyad/Triad Spec: ~60-120 tokens
- Evidence Snippets (Κφ ≤3): ~300-900 tokens
- Output Bounds (Γ6): ~20 tokens

### Execution Protocol
1. Hydrate skeleton (Ω, Ʃ7)
2. Activate dyad/triad with weights
3. Κφ fetch 1-3 evidence snippets
4. Execute cognitive pass → draft ≤7 sentences
5. Γ6 compress; Δ2 verify; Ρh check reversibility
6. If conflict → rotate per scheduler
